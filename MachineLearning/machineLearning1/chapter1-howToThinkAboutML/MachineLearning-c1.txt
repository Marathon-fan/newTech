1 rule based approach

2 


////-----------------------------------

Machine learning approach is similar to human-learning approach

Machine Learning-A computer program/system that can learn from "experience"

experience in computer is actural data

////-----------------------------------Knowing when to use Machine learning

how to travel from point A in map to point B
1 rule based
2 machine learning based approach


1 rule based approach
1)These rules are identified manually after a lot of research
2)rules are static
3)they change really slowly over time
4)any changes are made by human analysts

Traffic patterns on the other hand are dynamic

2 machine learning based approach
three steps:
1) collect a large amount of traffic data
2) use an algorithm to identify the relationship between the data and commute time
3) update this relationship continuously with new data

The difference between Rule based approach and ML based Approach is:
1) we need to change rules automatically in Rule based approach
2) rules are updated automatically based on data




////-----------------------------------
When to use Machine Learning!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1 difficult for humans to express rules
2 a large amount of historical data is available
3 patterns/relationships are dynamic

understanding the machine learning process
1 pick your problem
identify which type of problem we need to solve
ML problems generally fall under one of the following 4 categories:
1) classification
sentiment anaysis, spam detection
2) regression
sales forcasting
predicting the value of stock market index
3) clustering
Clustering: is the assignment of a set of observations into subsets (called clusters) so that observations in the same cluster are similar in some
sense. Clustering is a method of unsupervised learning, and a common technique for statistical data analysis used in many fields.
4) recommendations
product recommendations


2 represent data
represent data using numeric attributes
Data might be in the form of unstructured text, images, videos
Use meaningful numberic attributes to represent them

3 apply an algorithm
use a standard algorithm to find a model
use an algorithm to find patterns from the historical data
rules are meant to quantify relationships between variables
the rules together form something called a Model

a model can be 
1) a mathematical equation
2) a set of rules(if-then-else statements)

The chioce of algorithm depends mainly on the type of problem
1) classification
(1)Naive Bayes
(2)support vector machines

2) clustering
(1)K-means
(2)Hierarchical clustering

we can plug and play an algorithm

We need to spend our time and energy in picking our problem and representing data, as there are many 
plug-and-play algorithms.
apply an algorithm could be a model of experimentation!!!!

identifying the type of a machine learning problem

typical ML Workflow
1 pick your problem
Picking the problem involves making a number of thoughtful choices

///------
Classification
1) spam detection - is this email spam or Ham
2) sentiment analysis - is this tweet positive or negative
3) trading strategy - is this trading day going to be an up-day or down-day?

problem instance
an email/a tweet/ a trading day

category:
spam/ham
postive/negative
up-day/down-day

classifier---uses a set of instances for which the correct category memership is known


training data: tweets which are correctly classified as positive or negative

///------
regression
example1:
what will be the price of this stock on a given date?
example2:
how long will it take to commute from point A to point B?
example3:
what will be the sales of this product in a given week?

in regression, we are computing a continuous value(stock price/ commute time/sales)

we may assume the commute time depends on 
1) time of day
2) distance

Regression also requires training data(historical datapoints)
Like calculating commuting time:
we need the following data: data, time of day, distance, commute time


///------
clustering

say you have a large group of usrs for a social network
Divide the users into groups based on some common attributes

The key thing here is that the groups to be divided into are unknown beforehand(!!!!!) unlike classification

The algorithm divides users into groups. later, we might realize that these groups represent meaningful divisions.
for example, likes/dislikes, demographics

///------
recommendations
1 what kind of artists will this user like?
2 what are the top 10 book picks for this user?
3 if a user buys this phone, what else will they buy?

Based on a user's past behavoior, determine what else they might like or need

Collaborative filtering




2 represent data


3 apply an algorithm
