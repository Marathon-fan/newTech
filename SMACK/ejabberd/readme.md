Robust, Scalable and Extensible Realtime Server using XMPP, MQTT and SIP
```

XMPP
```
Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol (XMPP) is a communication protocol for message-oriented middleware based on XML (Extensible Markup Language). It enables the near-real-time exchange of structured yet extensible data between any two or more network entities.
```

MQTT
```
MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport) is an ISO standard (ISO/IEC PRF 20922)[3] publish-subscribe-based messaging protocol. It works on top of the TCP/IP protocol. 
```

SIP
```
The Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) is a signaling protocol used for initiating, maintaining, and terminating real-time sessions that include voice, video and messaging applications.

# NSQ    

```
NSQ promotes distributed and decentralized topologies without single points of failure, enabling fault tolerance and high availability coupled with a reliable message delivery guarantee.

**NSQ vs Kafka**

It's better to think of Kafka as a distributed log service than a messaging broker, like the write ahead log in a database and not printf statements. NSQ is a much more traditional buffered messaging system. ... It provides dead simple archiving of messages, but doesn't provide any native replay ability.
