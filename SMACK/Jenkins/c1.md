Jenkins Installation  

# use vagrant to install Jenkins   

```sh
mkdir tomcat
cd tomcat
vagrant init emessiha/ubuntu64-java       # this vm is with Tomcat pre-installed    

sudo nano Vagrantfile
change this line to :
config.vm.network "private_network", ip: "192.168.33.40"

# then 
vagrant up
vagrant ssh

# down load Jenkins war file from https://jenkins.io/download/
http://mirrors.jenkins.io/war/latest/jenkins.war
# 
cp jenkins.war /vagrant
mv jenkins.var /opt/tomcat/webapps/   

# then we can navigate to 192.168.33.40:8080 to see tomcat  
# 192.168.33.40:8080/jenkins
# then we can see the page of passwd, open the passwd, and use the passwd to 

# then install suggested plugins    
just click that link
After the installation, we create the first Jenkins admin user  


# then restart tomcat
logout
vagrant halt  
vagrant up   

# also we can use docker to install Jenkins, or use .deb to install Jenkins


```
