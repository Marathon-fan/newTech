Now strong with your newly designed flow, you take your whole data flow to a customer and they ask you to explain what the designed flow is doing. You start opening your favorite text editor, show them a few lines of code, and see each face just disintegrate in front of you while everyone in the room is just waiting for that coffee break to get closer. Even concepts like reading a log file or parsing an output seem to come from a different planet for a non-technical person who came to your meeting for the first time. If you have to explain your work to non-technical people, a data flow system with a graphical representation of the flow is a must.Enter: Apache NiFi.

NiFi in itself is not that much of a new project anymore â€” it has been around for the last two years already. But it sure builds on strong foundations from similar data flow systems.

What does it do?

Let's reuse the project's bang-on one sentence:
